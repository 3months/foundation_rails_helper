# FoundationRailsHelper

Gem for rails 3 application that uses the excellent Zurb Foundation framework.
It includes so far

* A custum FormBuilder to generate form with Foundation framework. It replaces the current `form_for` so you don't have to
change your rails code.
Errors messages are propertly displayed
* A `display_flash` helper method to use Zurb Foundation Alerts UI

This gem has only been tested with Rails 3.1 and ruby 1.9.2.
